    <h1>Test Driven Development</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Write a small Object-Oriented <!--or prototype-oriented--> JS program that can create Robots with some nice greetings and interactions, three or four actions are ok.</li>
        <li>Draw the robots in HTML, better if we can see their interactions.</li>
        <li>Write some tests for all these robots. At least 5 tests.</li>
        <li>Let us know how and what would you use to test their visual representations.</li>
        <li>Let us know how would you automate all these test.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3rd party libs for TDD are ok, let us know how you decided what to use.</li>
        <li>3rd party libs for drawing are ok too.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bonus</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Write a brief explanation of your OO pattern.</li>
