    <h1>Quiz</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Name three people that you follow, admire or recognize from the JS field
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford.</a>
                &nbsp;
                <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">This book rocks!</a>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://ejohn.org/">John Resig</a></li>
            <li>Really like this guy too.
              <a href="https://github.com/robwormald">Rob Wormald</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What's the name of the standard backing JS implementation?
          <ul>
            <li>The Javascript is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a> scripting language standardized by ECMA as <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">Ecma-262</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Name three major (old, current or new) JS implementations.
          <ul>
            <li>JScript</li>
            <li>Rhino</li>
            <li>V7</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Name four websites that you use constanly while web developing.
          <ul>
            <li>google</li>
            <li>stackoverflow</li>
            <li>github</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is minification and why we should use it? Do you use it? How?
          <ul>
            <li>Minification "is the process of removing all unneccessary characters from the source code without changing its functionality."  Yes, I use it all the time.  As a Rubyist, especially in the Rails framework, there is something called the asset pipeline which minifies all js and css files before deploy.  Usually, I will forgo minification on my local machine so as to speed up my own development environment and ensure that my local rails environment reloads and changes to my javascript files.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What is the DOM? And the BOM? What's the difference? Give us a one-line example of using each one.
          <ul>
            <li>DOM - the Document Object Model. Specifically, this is an API for HTML.  It defines a way the tree structure of an HTML page can be accessed.</li>
            <li>BOM - the Browser Object Model. This is dependent on individual browsers to implement.  The BOM is part of a collect of browser objects that Javascript can access. Example:
              <pre>
                window.document.getElementById("some_id_on_the_page")
              </pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Why is HTML5shiv important on some browsers?
          <ul>
            <li>The HTML5shiv is purpose is to provide support for HTML5 elements that Internet Explorer doesn't know about.  Basically, it makes IE8 suck less.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How many ways to communicate between two different domain pages do you know? (client-side, of course)
          <ul>
            <li>CORS - Cross-Origin resource sharing.</li>
            <li>JSONP - </li>
            <li>Call the window.open method with  targeted window name.</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Is <em>document.write</em> good or bad? When its good? When its bad?
          <ul>
            <li>Maybe. Depending on how or where you are loading a script file, document.write() can inadvertantly append partial or malformed HTML into a document.  Bottom line, make sure the page is loaded before using this. Otherwise, its the fastest way to add script generated text into a page. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What do you understand for self-invoking function? Do you use them? Why?
          <ul>
            <li>I seem to be using this more and more these days.  JS frameworks use the heck out of this technique, i.e. jQuery, Nodejs, Reactjs. The simple description is, if you have a function expression, you can make it self-invoke by adding a parenthesis to the end. Example, we can build an anonymous self-invoking function this way:
              <pre>
                (function(){
                  return console.log("Howdy Gum Gum!");
                })();
              </pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Do you use JSLint or JSHint? What about strict mode? Why?
          <ul>
            <li>The honest answer is, no.  I write a lot of coffeescript to start.  So, if I do use a linter I'll use coffeelint. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What do you know about memory leaks?</li>
        <li>Have you heard of the "Repainting" problem on the browser? Tell us about it.</li>
        <li>Write the best implementation of "blackBox" you can think of:
<pre>
    blackBox('GumGum') === 'GumGum'
    blackBox('GumGum','Test') === 'GumGum-Test:GumGum-Test'
    blackBox('GumGum','Test','Join Us') === "GumGum-Test-Join Us!:GumGum-Test-Join Us!:GumGum-Test-Join Us!"
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>What are you daily basis tools when coding and releasing your code?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Extras</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How would you deploy directly from your git repo?</li>
        <li>What does 664 means to you and your files?</li>
    </ol>
